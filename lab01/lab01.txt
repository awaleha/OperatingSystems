Review Question 1.5
-------------------
How are multiple interrupts dealt with?

Review Question 1.7
--------------------
What is cache memory?

Problem 1.1:
-------------
Suppose the hypothetical processor of Figure 1.3 also has two I/O instructions:
   0011 = Load AC from I/O
   0111 = Store AC to I/O
In these cases, the 12-bit address identifies a particular external device. show the pro-
gram execution (using format of Figure 1.4) for the following program:
1. Load AC from device 5.
2. Add contents of memory location 940.
3. Store AC to device 6.
Assume that the next value retrieved from device 5 is 3 and that location 940 contains
a value of 2.
