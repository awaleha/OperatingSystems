Questions: 3,4,5

(1)
Compile pids1.c into executable named pids1
Run pids1 to see the Process IDs of the parent and child processes.
(It will take a few seconds to complete).
Inspect the code to see what is happening.

Open another shell window in the same moon.
In shell 1 run program pids1, and while pids1 is sleeping, quickly...
In shell 2, do command: ps -u userid
  where "userid" is your login userid (I do: ps -u dwoit)

Check that the process IDs shown with the ps command in shell 2 are the same 
as printed by the parent and child processes running in shell 1.
Note:
You have to be quick enough. You have to do the "ps" in shell 2 while
the processes in shell 1 are still alive.

(2)
Consider program pids2.c
It is an exact copy of pids1.c except that the lines
       pid = getpid();
       ppid = getppid();
are moved inside the if statement. The lines are duplicated for the
parent and child, so, syntactically, it does not alter the program.
Compile into pids2 and run. 

(3)
Notice that when you run pids2, the Child process often thinks its parent 
has PID=1 whereas in pids1, the Child knew its parent's real PID. 
Why? 
Does this differ from general information given in your text about parent
and child?

(4)
Program pids3.c is a copy of pids2.c but with all the sleep commands removed.
Compile and run. If you run it enough times, you will notice it usually behaves
like pids1 (child gets correct parent pid), but sometimes it behaves like pids2
(child thinks its parent's pid is 1). It is unpredictable.
Why?
Note: if you want to see this more clearly, try running pids3 over and over, in a loop,
and each time only keep the output lines that end in "1". e.g., try copying-and-pasting
this into your shell window:
while [ 1 ] ; do 
  pids3 | grep Child | grep "1$"
done | more

This will show you that sometimes Child gets "1" as parent pid, and sometimes it 
gets its "birth-parent"'s pid.

**NOTE** You may need to ctrl-c a couple of times to stop the while loop.


(5)
Copy pids3.c to pids4.c
Use the man pages to see what the "wait" system call does.
Use the wait function to guarantee pids4.c will get its birth-parent's pid
by not allowing the parent to die while the child is still running. 
Make sure to use the "wait" command, and don't use any "sleep" commands at all.
Where did you put the wait function call? 
What was the exact syntax you used?
Did you have to include anything else? If so, what?
